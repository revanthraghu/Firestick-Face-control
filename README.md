# Firestick-Face-control
This python project makes use of facial recognition algorithm to detect if a person is not watching media playing on the firestick and sends commands to the firestick over adb to pause the media. 
<br/>
If a persons face is detected again then the program sends a command to the firestick to start playing the media again. The project was tested successfully using laptop webcam and also tested using a camera module connected to a raspberry pi. There are a number of adb commands that can be used to control the firestick that could be used to improve the projects capabilities.
